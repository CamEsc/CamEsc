## ✨ My Story — Why Data?

I started out in **Psychology and Human Resources**, curious about what drives people and organizations.  
Working in **Tech Recruitment** helped me understand processes and behavior — but what really caught my attention was the data behind it all.  

Over time, I realized that numbers could explain patterns, improve decisions, and tell stories that people alone couldn’t see.  
That’s what led me to the world of **Data & Business Analytics** — where logic meets human insight.  

Now, wile flying as a **Cabin Crew**, I’m pursuing a **Master’s in Business Analytics**, connecting my passion for people with data-driven decisions
